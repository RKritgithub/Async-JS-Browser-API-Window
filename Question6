Q6.Describe the purpose and usage of the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs in web development. Give
suitable examples for each.

ANSWERS6:

- **localStorage**: Stores data with no expiration time. The data persists even when the browser is closed and reopened. It is useful for storing long-term data like user preferences.
  
  Example:
  ```javascript
  localStorage.setItem('username', 'JohnDoe');
  console.log(localStorage.getItem('username'));  // Outputs: JohnDoe
  ```

- **sessionStorage**: Stores data for the duration of the page session. The data is cleared when the page is closed.
  
  Example:
  ```javascript
  sessionStorage.setItem('sessionID', '12345');
  console.log(sessionStorage.getItem('sessionID'));  // Outputs: 12345
