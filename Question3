ANSWER3:

The **same-origin policy** is a security measure implemented by browsers to restrict web pages from making AJAX requests to a domain different from the one that served the web page. This prevents malicious websites from accessing sensitive data from other websites.

To work around this, you can:
- Use **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** headers on the server to allow cross-origin requests.
- Implement **JSONP** (though it's less secure) for data retrieval from other origins.
- Utilize **proxy servers** to make requests on behalf of the client.
